        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "OptimalpH is a tool designed to predict the optimal pH for hydrolase enzymes activity using machine learning models. This Google Colab notebook allows for batch processing of protein sequences to predict the pH range where hydrolases exhibit maximum catalytic activity.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook utilizes ESM2-650M protein language model embeddings developed by Meta AI Research to train machine learning models including KNN, XGBoost, and K-mers.\n",
