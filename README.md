# OptimalpH-Colab: Predict Optimal pH for Enzyme Activity

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]([https://colab.research.google.com/github/Loganz97/optimalpH_colab/blob/main/OptimalpH-Colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HE5B2Oy82zmgLyB4lhPOly-JPJKfT4A9?usp=sharing))

## Introduction

OptimalpH is a tool designed to predict the optimal pH range for enzyme activity using machine learning models. This Google Colab notebook allows for batch processing of protein sequences to predict the pH range where enzymes exhibit maximum catalytic activity.

The notebook utilizes ESM-2-650M protein language model embeddings developed by Meta AI Research and trains machine learning models including KNN, XGBoost, and K-mers.

### Author Information

This notebook provides a user-friendly interface for predicting a collection of metrics that aid in the expression, purification, and screening of hydrolases created by **Logan Hessefort** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/logan-hessefort/)).

This project was created as part of a **US Department of Energy SCGSR Fellowship** ([details](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/scgsr)) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory with additional support from the **US National Science Foundation** ([grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2132183&HistoricalAwards=false)).

### Training Data

The models were trained using approximately **2,840 data points from the BRENDA** enzyme database and **169,517 data points from the Mean Growth pH dataset**. The data were processed through clustering techniques such as DBSCAN and CD-HIT, followed by hyperparameter tuning and evaluation on various splits to optimize prediction accuracy.

## How to Use

1. Click the "Open in Colab" button at the top of this README.
2. Run the cells sequentially in the notebook.
3. Upload your CSV file when prompted (see Input CSV Structure below).
4. Select the desired model type.
5. The notebook will process each sequence and output a consolidated CSV file with the results.

### Input CSV Structure

Your input CSV should contain the following columns:

- `ID`: A unique identifier for each protein sequence
- `Sequence`: The amino acid sequence of the protein

Example format:

| ID       | Sequence       |
|:--------:|:--------------:|
| Protein1 | MVKPKLFYV...   |
| Protein2 | MGSRHYPLG...   |

**Note:** Ensure all sequences are valid amino acid sequences using single-letter codes.

### Output

The script generates a comprehensive CSV file containing:

- ID
- Sequence
- Molecular Weight
- Oxidized Cystine Extinction Coefficient
- Isoelectric Point
- Predicted Optimal pH
- Lysine Count
- Arginine Count
- Cysteine Count
- Instability Index
- Stability Prediction (Stable, Moderately Stable, Unstable)
- Hydrophobicity Score

## Key Protein Properties Explained

- **GRAVY Score**: Measures overall protein hydrophobicity (range typically -2 to +2).
- **Isoelectric Point (pI)**: pH at which a protein carries no net electrical charge (range typically 3 to 12).
- **Instability Index**: Estimates protein stability in vitro (â‰¤40 predicted as stable, >40 as unstable).

## Local Installation

If you prefer to run the tool locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Loganz97/optimalpH_colab.git
   ```

2. Create a conda environment:
   ```
   conda create -n esm_env --file package-list.txt
   conda activate esm_env
   ```

3. Run the prediction script:
   ```
   python3 code/predict.py --input_csv sequences.csv --seq_col sequence --model_fname weights/model_xgboost --output_csv sequences_scored.csv
   ```
