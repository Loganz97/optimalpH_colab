# License for OphPred Model Weights

This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).

## Scope and Exceptions:

This license applies **ONLY** to the weights of the OphPred model. The following clarifications and exceptions apply:

1. **Model Weights**: The trained weights of the OphPred model are covered by this license.

2. **Predictions**: The predictions generated by the OphPred model are **NOT** covered by this license. Users are free to use the predictions generated by the model for any purpose, including commercial applications, without the restrictions imposed by this license. However, users should be aware that:
   a. The act of running the model to generate predictions may be subject to the terms of this license.
   b. Large-scale reproduction or distribution of the model's predictions may indirectly disclose information about the model weights, which could potentially infringe on this license.

3. **Model Architecture**: The general architecture and design of the OphPred model are not covered by this license and may be subject to intellectual property rights.

4. **Training Data**: The dataset used to train the model is not covered by this license and may have its own terms of use.

5. **External Components**: The following components are **NOT** covered by this license:
   - The ESM-2 protein language model
   - Documentation, papers, or other written materials describing the model
   - Any other software tools or libraries used in conjunction with OphPred

These excluded components may be subject to their own licenses and terms of use. Users should refer to the appropriate documentation or source for licensing information on these components.
